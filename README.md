# TheUnityNetwork
Proof of Ethics blockchain
The first block of code defines the EthicalMetrics class, which holds the ethical metrics for each transaction. This class has attributes for environmental_responsibility, social_equality, economic_fairness, and transparency.

Here’s a demonstration of how an instance of EthicalMetrics would look with sample values:

{'environmental_responsibility': 50, 'social_equality': 60, 'economic_fairness': 40, 'transparency': 70}
# Extending the EthicalMetrics class to include methods for calculating and validating ethical scores.
class EthicalMetrics:
    def __init__(self, environmental_responsibility=0, social_equality=0, economic_fairness=0, transparency=0):
        self.environmental_responsibility = environmental_responsibility
        self.social_equality = social_equality
        self.economic_fairness = economic_fairness
        self.transparency = transparency

    def calculate_ethical_score(self):
        return self.environmental_responsibility + self.social_equality + self.economic_fairness + self.transparency

    def is_ethical(self, threshold=70):
        return self.calculate_ethical_score() >= threshold

# Testing EthicalMetrics class with calculation and validation methods
ethical_metrics_instance = EthicalMetrics(50, 60, 40, 70)
ethical_score = ethical_metrics_instance.calculate_ethical_score()
is_ethical = ethical_metrics_instance.is_ethical()

ethical_score, is_ethical
# Next, let's define the UnityToken class, which represents a Unity Token holder in the Unity Network.
class UnityToken:
    def __init__(self, holder):
        self.holder = holder
        self.civic_points = 0
        self.voting_enabled = True

    def add_civic_points(self, points):
        self.civic_points += points

    def enable_voting(self):
        self.voting_enabled = True

    def disable_voting(self):
        self.voting_enabled = False

# Testing UnityToken class
unity_token_holder = UnityToken("John Doe")
unity_token_holder.add_civic_points(50)
unity_token_holder.disable_voting()

unity_token_holder.__dict__
# Next, let's define the EnvironmentalAction class, which represents actions contributing to environmental sustainability.
class EnvironmentalAction:
    def __init__(self, action_type, points_awarded):
        self.action_type = action_type
        self.points_awarded = points_awarded

# Testing EnvironmentalAction class
environmental_action = EnvironmentalAction("Recycling", 10)

environmental_action.__dict__
The UnityToken class represents a Unity Token holder in the Unity Network. This class has the following attributes and methods:

	•	holder: The name or identifier of the Unity Token holder.
	•	civic_points: The number of civic points the holder has accrued.
	•	voting_enabled: A boolean value indicating whether the holder is eligible for voting.
	•	add_civic_points(points): Adds civic points to the holder.
	•	enable_voting(): Enables voting for the holder.
	•	disable_voting(): Disables voting for the holder.

Here’s a demonstration of how an instance of UnityToken would look with sample values:

{'holder': 'John Doe', 'civic_points': 50, 'voting_enabled': False}
# Next, let's define the EnvironmentalAction class, which represents actions contributing to environmental sustainability.
class EnvironmentalAction:
    def __init__(self, action_type, points_awarded):
        self.action_type = action_type
        self.points_awarded = points_awarded

# Testing EnvironmentalAction class
environmental_action = EnvironmentalAction("Recycling", 10)

environmental_action.__dict__
The EnvironmentalAction class represents actions that contribute to environmental sustainability. This class has two attributes:

	•	action_type: The type of environmental action (e.g., “Recycling”).
	•	points_awarded: The number of civic points awarded for performing the action.

Here’s a demonstration of how an instance of EnvironmentalAction would look with sample values:

{'action_type': 'Recycling', 'points_awarded': 10}
# Next, let's define the Guardian class, which represents a Guardian Token holder in the Unity Network.
class Guardian:
    def __init__(self, guardian_id):
        self.guardian_id = guardian_id
        self.votes_received = 0

    def receive_vote(self):
        self.votes_received += 1

    def validate_civic_action(self, unity_token_holder, points):
        if True:  # Replace with real validation logic
            unity_token_holder.add_civic_points(points)

    def validate_utility(self, utility_proposal):
        return utility_proposal.votes > 50  # Threshold for example

# Testing Guardian class
guardian_instance = Guardian("Guardian_1")
guardian_instance.receive_vote()
guardian_instance.validate_civic_action(unity_token_holder, 20)

guardian_instance.__dict__, unity_token_holder.__dict__
The Guardian class represents a Guardian Token holder in the Unity Network. This class has the following attributes and methods:

	•	guardian_id: The identifier for the Guardian.
	•	votes_received: The number of votes received by the Guardian.
	•	receive_vote(): Increases the number of votes received by one.
	•	validate_civic_action(unity_token_holder, points): Validates a civic action and awards points to the Unity Token holder.
	•	validate_utility(utility_proposal): Validates a utility proposal based on a voting threshold.

Here’s a demonstration of how an instance of Guardian and an updated instance of UnityToken would look with sample values:

# Guardian instance: {'guardian_id': 'Guardian_1', 'votes_received': 1}
# Updated UnityToken instance: {'holder': 'John Doe', 'civic_points': 70, 'voting_enabled': False}
# Next, let's define the UtilityProposal class, which represents a proposal for adding a new utility to the Unity Network.
class UtilityProposal:
    def __init__(self, proposed_by, utility_name):
        self.proposed_by = proposed_by
        self.utility_name = utility_name
        self.votes = 0

    def receive_vote(self):
        self.votes += 1

# Testing UtilityProposal class
utility_proposal_instance = UtilityProposal("John Doe", "ALC UBI")
utility_proposal_instance.receive_vote()

utility_proposal_instance.__dict__
The UtilityProposal class represents a proposal for adding a new utility to the Unity Network. This class has the following attributes and methods:

	•	proposed_by: The Unity Token holder who proposed the utility.
	•	utility_name: The name of the proposed utility.
	•	votes: The number of votes the proposal has received.
	•	receive_vote(): Increases the number of votes received by one.

Here’s a demonstration of how an instance of UtilityProposal would look with sample values:

{'proposed_by': 'John Doe', 'utility_name': 'ALC UBI', 'votes': 1}
# Now, let's define the Block class, which represents a block in the Unity Network's blockchain.
class Block:
    def __init__(self, transactions):
        self.transactions = transactions

    def validate_block(self, guardians):
        for transaction in self.transactions:
            ethical_metrics = EthicalMetrics(**transaction)
            if not ethical_metrics.is_ethical():
                return False
        return True

# Testing Block class
sample_transactions = [
    {'environmental_responsibility': 20, 'social_equality': 25, 'economic_fairness': 15, 'transparency': 20},
    {'environmental_responsibility': 50, 'social_equality': 40, 'economic_fairness': 45, 'transparency': 50}
]
block_instance = Block(sample_transactions)
block_instance.validate_block(None)  # Guardians are not used in this example yet
The Block class represents a block in the Unity Network’s blockchain. This class has the following attributes and methods:

	•	transactions: A list of transactions included in the block.
	•	validate_block(guardians): Validates all transactions in the block. Currently, guardians are not used in this example, but they will be in future implementations.

Here’s a demonstration of how the block would be validated with sample transactions:

# The block is valid: True
# Finally, let's define the Node class, which represents a node in the Unity Network's blockchain.
class Node:
    def __init__(self):
        self.blockchain = []
        self.guardians = []

    def add_guardian(self, guardian):
        self.guardians.append(guardian)

    def receive_block(self, block):
        if block.validate_block(self.guardians):
            self.blockchain.append(block)

    def propose_utility(self, utility_proposal):
        for guardian in self.guardians:
            if guardian.validate_utility(utility_proposal):
                utility_proposal.receive_vote()

# Testing Node class
node_instance = Node()
node_instance.add_guardian(guardian_instance)
node_instance.receive_block(block_instance)
node_instance.propose_utility(utility_proposal_instance)

len(node_instance.blockchain), utility_proposal_instance.__dict__

The Node class represents a node in the Unity Network’s blockchain. This class has the following attributes and methods:

	•	blockchain: A list that holds the blocks in the blockchain.
	•	guardians: A list of guardians who validate transactions and proposals.
	•	add_guardian(guardian): Adds a guardian to the list.
	•	receive_block(block): Validates and receives a block.
	•	propose_utility(utility_proposal): Proposes a new utility to be added to the network.

Here’s a demonstration with sample data:

# Number of blocks in the blockchain: 1
# Utility proposal instance: {'proposed_by': 'John Doe', 'utility_name': 'ALC UBI', 'votes': 1}
# Adding secure features including sharding to the Node class in Unity Network's blockchain.

class Shard:
    def __init__(self):
        self.blockchain = []

    def add_block(self, block):
        self.blockchain.append(block)

class SecureNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.shards = [Shard() for _ in range(3)]  # Creating 3 shards for demonstration

    def distribute_block_to_shard(self, block, shard_index):
        self.shards[shard_index].add_block(block)

    def cryptographic_check(self, transaction):
        # Placeholder for cryptographic checks
        return True

    def governance_contract(self):
        # Placeholder for governance contract logic
        pass

# Testing SecureNode class with sharding
secure_node_instance = SecureNode()
secure_node_instance.add_guardian(guardian_instance)
secure_node_instance.distribute_block_to_shard(block_instance, 0)

len(secure_node_instance.shards[0].blockchain)
The SecureNode class extends the Node class to include secure features and sharding. Here are the additions:

	•	Shard class: Represents a shard with its own blockchain.
	•	shards: A list of shards that the node will manage.
	•	distribute_block_to_shard(block, shard_index): Distributes a block to a specific shard.
	•	cryptographic_check(transaction): Placeholder for cryptographic checks.
	•	governance_contract(): Placeholder for governance contract logic.

Here’s a demonstration of how sharding works with sample data:

# Number of blocks in the first shard: 1
# Integrating VotingMechanism into the SecureNode class

class SecureNodeWithVoting(SecureNode):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.voting_mechanism = VotingMechanism()
        self.total_unity_holders = 0  # Placeholder, this would be dynamically calculated

    def add_unity_holder(self, unity_holder):
        self.total_unity_holders += 1

    def execute_votes(self):
        new_guardians, removed_guardians = self.voting_mechanism.check_guardian_status(self.total_unity_holders)
        
        for guardian in new_guardians:
            self.add_guardian(guardian)
        
        for guardian in removed_guardians:
            self.guardians.remove(guardian)

# Testing SecureNodeWithVoting class
secure_node_voting_instance = SecureNodeWithVoting()
secure_node_voting_instance.add_unity_holder(unity_token_holder)
secure_node_voting_instance.voting_mechanism.vote_for_guardian("New_Candidate", unity_token_holder)
secure_node_voting_instance.execute_votes()

len(secure_node_voting_instance.guardians)
The SecureNodeWithVoting class extends SecureNode to include the voting mechanism. The new features are:

	•	voting_mechanism: An instance of the VotingMechanism class to handle voting.
	•	total_unity_holders: A counter for the total number of Unity Token holders, dynamically calculated.
	•	add_unity_holder(unity_holder): Adds a Unity Token holder and updates the counter.
	•	execute_votes(): Executes the voting mechanism, adding or removing guardians based on votes.

Here’s a demonstration with sample data:

# Number of guardians in the node after voting: 0

This shows that no new guardians were added based on the test votes and the current total number of Unity Token holders (1 in this example).
